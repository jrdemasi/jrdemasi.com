This repo serves to host the lektor project used to build out my website, [jrdemasi.com](https://jrdemasi.com).  I doubt anyone would want to clone it directly, seeing as it's *my* website with *my* content, but feel free to use and abuse however you wish.  If you've got any questions about using Lektor or anything, please don't hesitate to ask. 

The site itself uses the [Clean Blog](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/) theme, and most of the rest is my own.
